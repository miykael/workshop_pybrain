    "\n",
    "Python is on its way to become the most used programming language in neuroscience. It is easy to understand, can be learned rather quickly and has a very strong and helpful community behind it. There exist many amazing neuroimaging software packages, such as Nipype & fmriprep, that facilitate the everyday life of a neuroscientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this 2-day workshop is to introduce participants to the basics of Python, to give them a short overview about relevant neuroimaging software packages and most of all, to teach them everything they need to know about Nipype. Nipype is an open-source software package, that provides a unified way of interfacing with most of the freely available neuroimaging software packages, such as SPM, FSL, AFNI, FreeSurfer, and ANTs.\n",
